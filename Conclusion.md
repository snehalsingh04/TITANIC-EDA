Based on the exploratory data analysis and visualizations, we can draw the following conclusions:
Survival Rate by Sex: The survival rate for females was significantly higher than for males.
This could be attributed to the "women and children first" protocol followed during the evacuation of the Titanic.

Age Distribution: The age distribution of passengers shows a peak around the age of 20-30 years,
with a gradual decline towards both ends of the age spectrum. 
This suggests that a significant portion of passengers were young adults or in their prime years.

Fare Distribution: The fare distribution is heavily skewed towards lower fares, 
indicating that a majority of passengers were traveling in lower-class cabins or with more economical ticket prices. 
However, there is a long tail towards higher fares, suggesting that some passengers were traveling in more luxurious accommodations.

Survival Rate by Passenger Class: Further analysis could be conducted to investigate the relationship between 
passenger class (Pclass) and survival rate. It is likely that passengers in higher classes 
had a better chance of survival due to their proximity to lifeboats and other factors.

Family Size and Survival: The newly added 'Family_Size' column could be analyzed to understand 
if traveling with family members or alone had any impact on the chances of survival.
These insights provide a glimpse into the demographics of the Titanic passengers and 
how factors like sex, age, fare, and passenger class might have influenced their chances of survival during the tragic event.
